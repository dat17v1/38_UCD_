# Calculator

Create a Simple Calculater that takes as many inputs as wanted.    

Start out by making the calculater **add** numbers.    

When this works you can go on to the other operators.    

The result should be something like this:


`````
    Number: 4
    Operator: +
    Number: 5
    Operator: +
    Number: 4
    Operator: +
    Number: 7
    Operator: =
    Result: 20
`````
